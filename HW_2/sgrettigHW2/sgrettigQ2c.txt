Constraint 1:
One conststraint that cannot be applied is the total particapation for the Employees 
table. given the current design, it cannot be effectively be modeled.


Constraint 2:

In the bought_from table, the total particapation cannot also be enforced here as well.
It comes initially from the products entity set, and requires a trigger to be enforced.
